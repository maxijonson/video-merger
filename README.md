# video-merger

After recording many long Instagram stories, I was disapointed that they split your stories into 15 second segments. I didn't want to start merging them manually, so I created this server. It was developed with the intention of calling it from iOS Shortcuts, so although it can merge videos, it doesn't have any UI and is very limited to what I needed to get the job done.

## Requirements

You may host this server on your local machine or on a cloud server, such as Heroku. Whichever one you choose, make sure FFMPEG is installed and is in your PATH.

## Usage (Local)

If you're running locally, you can just use ts-node to run the server.

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage (Heroku)

## iOS Shortcut Config
